Wow. Just... wow. Still feeling like the chatter of everyone leaving the theater mixing with the buzz in my head, like I'm trying to swat away bees made of sound. Had popcorn stuck all over me — like those thoughts you can't shake off no matter how much you mental floss, y’know?

Where do I even start? That scene, the one with the flickering neon, felt like a lightning bug got trapped in a jar and decided to whisper all its secrets to me at once — it’s got this electric hum going, you know? My back's killing me from those seats (who designed those contraptions, a medieval torturer?), but I can't move, like I'm protesting on this bench for the sake of my overwhelmed brain.

> The way the main guy just stared into the chaos, like a chef too damn good at juggling eggshells in a hurricane. You know that feeling when you’re overthinking if you locked the door and then something in the   just clicks. Unexpected yet oddly familiar, like finding a forgotten snack at the bottom of a backpack. 

Was it about control, or the lack of it? I felt my own grip slip through my fingers like remembering you forgot to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   someone recommended, and now you're just trying to hold onto pixels of a scene that fades faster than cotton candy on your tongue. Yes, someone definitely told me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . Or was it to forget it? Same same. 

The guy sitting next to me was snoring so loud it almost synced up to the beat of the score, which was kinda creepy, like maybe he was part of the soundtrack all along — probably just needs to eat a few cucumbers and chill. Didn’t help the vibe, but maybe it's part of the experience. 

Remember the bit with that old radio, constantly tuning in and out of static, like when you're scrolling through your thoughts and only static makes sense? It was nostalgic in a way that wasn’t nostalgia. More like a déjà vu of someone else's dream you accidentally 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed into your own sleep.

My brain’s like a puzzle missing half the pieces, but I'm oddly satisfied with the hollow roar of it. Dogs barking somewhere distant—random neighborhood soundtrack. I wonder if they'll find those pieces for me or if they're just scattered forever.
